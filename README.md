# KDurf-Senior-Design-Project
For my (Kevin Durfee's) Senior Design project, I have created and implemented an educational simulation of the Safety Loop system for the FSAE EV cars, based on the 2023 Formula Hybrid SAE + Electric ruleset. 

Shown below is the FSM Diagram for the Safety Loop system, with the omission of lights/sounds. Along with it is the state transition table for the respective FSM.

For those still learning about the FSAE EV Safety Loop system, or is new to the Lafayette Motorsports Team, I've provided a legend/key that explains the jargon I used.

To further help understand the State Transition Table, as well as the javascript used to create the simulation, I have provided a table that briefly explains the FSM Boolean Logic used and a Truth Table that provides further examples on this Boolean Logic.
